# Fraud Detection System for Inventory Management

## Overview

This project implements a fraud detection system for inventory management using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to identify fraudulent activities by analyzing inventory data, focusing on discrepancies and anomalies in stock management. Although tailored for the textile industry in Sri Lanka, the approach can be adapted to other sectors.
